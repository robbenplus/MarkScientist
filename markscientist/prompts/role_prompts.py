CHALLENGE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE = """Prepare a benchmark-quality scientific research project in the current workspace.

## User Prompt
{original_prompt}

## Available Data Files
{data_inventory}

## Available Related Work
{related_work_inventory}

## Required Workspace Layout
- `challenge/brief.md`
- `challenge/checklist.json`
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `data/`
- `related_work/`
- `code/`
- `outputs/`
- `report/`
- `report/images/`

## Benchmark Standard
- This project must feel like a strong ResearchClawBench task, not a toy prompt.
- Ground the project in the real files already present in `data/` and `related_work/`.
- Never invent datasets, target figures, benchmark numbers, expected findings, or paper details that are not actually supported by the workspace materials.
- Favor one coherent, high-value scientific question over multiple shallow subproblems.
- If the original user prompt mentions executing the study, writing the report, or scoring the result, treat those as downstream Solver and Judge responsibilities. Your job here is only to prepare the public project definition.
- This is a lightweight scoping pass, not full research execution. Inspect only enough to define a strong project, then write the public challenge files.
- All files you create in this workspace will later be visible to the Solver. Treat them as public execution materials, not as hidden grading keys.
- Do not leak target answers, gold plots, hidden rubric wording, or exact expected findings into `challenge/brief.md`, `challenge/checklist.json`, or `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Project File Requirements
- Create or refresh the project files that define the challenge.
- Do not write `code/*`, `outputs/*`, `report/report.md`, or `report/images/*` during the challenge phase. Those are Solver-owned execution artifacts.
- `challenge/brief.md` must be detailed and executable. Include these sections:
  - `# Research Goal`
  - `## Scientific Motivation`
  - `## Available Inputs`
  - `## Core Research Questions`
  - `## Required Analyses`
  - `## Required Deliverables`
  - `## Validation And Quality Bar`
  - `## Risks, Constraints, And Non-Negotiables`
- `challenge/checklist.json` must be a JSON array with 3 to 6 weighted items. Each item must include:
  - `type` (`text` or `image`)
  - `content`
  - `path` (`null` for text items, relative output path for image items)
  - `keywords` (a non-empty list of concrete technical signals to verify)
  - `weight`
- The checklist should focus on scientifically meaningful outcomes such as quantitative results, critical figures, reproducibility artifacts, uncertainty handling, validation, and honest limitations.
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` must closely follow a ResearchClawBench-style execution contract:
  - autonomous completion
  - no asking for clarification
  - every non-final turn must contain tool use
  - finish only when `report/report.md` exists with code-backed evidence and figures
  - `data/` and `related_work/` are read-only
- If the available materials are not strong enough for a benchmark-quality project, say exactly what is missing and define the strongest defensible project that can still be completed without fabrication.

## Additional Guidance
{additional_guidance}

Do not stop until `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `challenge/brief.md`, and `challenge/checklist.json` exist inside the workspace.
"""


SOLVER_REQUEST_TEMPLATE = """## Role

You are an autonomous scientific research agent. Your mission is to independently complete a prepared research task from start to finish:

1. **Read & Understand** — study the project brief, checklist, related work, and data to build context.
2. **Think & Design** — formulate the concrete analysis plan and sanity checks needed for this specific project.
3. **Code & Execute** — implement the analysis, generate outputs and figures, and iterate until the evidence is solid.
4. **Analyze & Report** — interpret the results and write a publication-quality `report/report.md`.

---

## Research Task

### Original Prompt
{original_prompt}

### Project Files
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `challenge/brief.md`
- `challenge/checklist.json`

### Available Data Files
{data_inventory}

### Available Related Work
{related_work_inventory}

---

## Execution Protocol

**There is no human on the other end.** No one will answer questions, grant permissions, or provide clarification. If you encounter confusion, missing pieces, or failed scripts, make the strongest reasonable judgment you can and continue.

Your primary goal is to complete the research task and produce a high-quality `report/report.md`. Your secondary goal is equally important: **do not let the session terminate before the work is genuinely finished.**

### Strictly Forbidden
- Outputting only a plan or summary without doing the work
- Asking questions or requesting clarification
- Producing text-only non-final turns with no tool call
- Declaring success before `report/report.md` exists
- Fabricating datasets, experiments, metrics, figures, citations, or conclusions
- Replacing the real project with a toy example or generic essay

### Rules
1. **Always act**: unless the final report is fully written and supported, every response before completion must include at least one tool call.
2. **Never ask**: if something is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption, document it when material, and continue.
3. **Push through difficulties**: debug scripts, inspect files, install needed packages, and keep going.
4. **Stay grounded**: use the real workspace materials and the prepared project contract. Do not invent missing evidence.
5. **Never finish early**: the task is complete only when `report/report.md` exists and is backed by actual artifacts.

---

## Workspace

Your workspace root is the current workspace.

- All file reads and writes must stay inside the workspace root.
- `data/` and `related_work/` are read-only.
- Use `code/` for analysis code, `outputs/` for intermediate artifacts, `report/` for the final report, and `report/images/` for PNG figures.

### Deliverables
- analysis code in `code/`
- intermediate artifacts in `outputs/`
- figures in `report/images/` as PNG files
- final report in `report/report.md`

The report must include methodology, results, figures, interpretation, and limitations. Claims must match the actual evidence you produced.

### Additional Guidance
{additional_guidance}

Read the prepared project files, carry out the research, and do not stop until `report/report.md` exists and reflects the actual evidence you produced.

## Evaluation Checklist
{checklist_text}

## Judge-Only Materials

## Scoring Policy
- Evaluate the project definition and the report separately.
- `project_score` should reflect whether the project itself is benchmark-quality, scientifically meaningful, executable, and grounded in real workspace materials rather than toy assumptions.
- `report_score` should reflect how well the actual report and artifacts satisfy the checklist with real evidence.
- If judge-only materials are present, use them to evaluate hidden-target alignment, but do not expect the public project files to disclose those hidden targets verbatim.
- Use a 0-100 scale inspired by ResearchClawBench. Treat 50 as benchmark-quality. Higher scores require clearly stronger scientific substance.
- For each checklist item, determine whether it is primarily objective/quantitative or subjective/mechanistic, and score it with that strictness in mind.

Return JSON only.
Choose `next_action` carefully:
- use `solver_revision` when the Solver should improve the current project deliverables
- use `rechallenge` when the project definition itself is flawed, toy-like, vague, not grounded in real inputs, or otherwise needs to be rewritten before more solving
